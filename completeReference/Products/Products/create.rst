Creating a Product
------------------


Binding a Product to a Product Family
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Every product may be bound to one `product family </completeReference/Products/ProductFamilies>`_. The default one contains generic product attributes (e.g. SKU, name, description, metadata, etc.) Custom product family contains the generic product attributes and any number of custom attributes organized in groups.

When creating a new product, after you select a custom product family and click **Continue**, the default and custom product attributes are shown as tabbed groups between the standard *General* product details and before the *Inventory* details. Depending on attribute type each attribute has corresponding input (date picker, file, text area, select).
