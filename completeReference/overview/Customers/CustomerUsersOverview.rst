Customer users act on behalf of the company and may have a limited set of permissions in OroCommerce, depending on their function in the customer organization.

For customer user management, navigate to the **Customers > Customer Users** in the main menu.

In Customer Users section, you can:

* View, edit and create new customer users
* Select their roles in OroCommerce to define their level of permissions and access to the actions and data in OroCommerce Front
* Manage customer user information:

    - Name
    - Birthday
    - Email address
    - Billing and shipping address and phone number (using `address book <../../shared/common-actions/manage-address-book>`_)
    - Customer user role(s)
    - Website to redirect the customer upon login
* View requests for quotes, sales orders, quotes created or submitted by the customer user
* View communication with the customer that happened using email, notes or scheduled events
* View additional information attached to customer user
* Enable and disable the customer
* Reset the customer user password

.. note:: You can delegate this function to the customer who will access user and role management in the OroCommmerce front store (see `Delegating Users and Role Management to the Customer </completeReference/Customers/delegate>`_ for more information).
