You can manage widgets, using tools in their header:

|

The header of each widget (above) contains (from left to right):

- Collapse/Expand button: if a widget has been collapsed, only its header will be displayed on the dashboard.

- Widget name: widget title displayed on the dashboard.

- Move button: click the button and hold the mouse button, to move the widget around the dashboard.

- Settings button: click the button to adjust the widget. You can change:

  - Widget title: the name displayed on the dashboard.
  
  - Date range: time for which the widget details are displayed.
  
  - Other widget details if any.

Dashboard Tools
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
