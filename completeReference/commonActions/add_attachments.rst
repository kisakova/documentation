Adding an Attachment
====================

.. warning:: Reused from OroCRM. Rework.

You can add an attachment to some system items in OroCommerce (e.g. Orders, Quotes, etc). Attchaments may be disabled for some items in system configuration, and every system item may have different attachment limitations (file types, size, and the way attachment links to the context).

.. note:: You may not be able to view or add attachments if your role or sytem configuration disable those options.

To add attachment to the item:

1. Click **Add Attachment**. It may be nesting in the **More Actions** menu.
