EU VAT tax for digital products

2. Clear the **Use Default** check and click on **Choose the value**. To filter list of product tax codes, start typing the code name. The list refreshes automatically to show the values matching the text you enter. Once the necessary product code is found, select it to add to the Digital Products Tax Codes list.
