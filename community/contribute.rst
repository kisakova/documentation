Contributing to OroPlatform, OroCommerce and OroCRM Source Code
===============================================================

We'd love for you to contribute to a free OroCommerce Community Edition open source code and related documentation. Following guidelines and recommendations help syncronize the community actions and provide a blueprint for seamless and non-intrusive collaboration.

Submitting a Pull Request
=========================

The best way to contribute a bug fix or enhancement is to submit a `pull request`_ to the `OroCommerce on Github <http://github.com/orocommerce/>`_.

Before doing any changes to the code, please, search GitHub for an open or closed Pull Request that relates to your submission. This way you may save some time and efforts on development of a duplicate solution.

Before submitting your source code changes in a pull request, please sign our `Contributor License Agreement`_ (CLA). The CLA must be signed for any code or documentation changes to be accepted.

Signing a Contributor License Agreement
=======================================

In order to accept your pull request, we need you to sign the `Contributor License Agreement`_ (CLA). You only need to do this once, so if you've done this for any of our open source projects, you're good to go with all of them. If you are submitting a pull request for the first time, our friendly *orocla* robot will automatically add a reminder to your pull request.
